# 使用launch screen flie(storyboard)注意事项
```
Note that if you are deploying to iOS 7 you will still need to include the static launch image files. You can include both a launch image file and static launch images. Devices such as the iPhone 6 running iOS 8 will use the launch image file whilst iOS 7 devices will fallback to the launch images.
